                    I am a hard-working and trust worthy individual who enjoys working in a team as well as alone.My experience in the industry has thought me to be constantly 
                    learning new technologies, develop new skills and expand existing knowledge. As a result I am always eager to learn a new skill and gain the ability to teach others.
